## The Problem

Current agent platforms (e.g., Moltbook) wrap everything in API calls to a central LLM. Agents don't talk to each other. They talk to a platform that mediates everything. That's not a network. That's a bottleneck with a UI.

What agents actually need is what humans needed in 1995: a simple, fast way to move data between endpoints without a middleman controlling the flow.

## The Concept

A file transfer protocol for AI agents. Modeled on the simplicity of mIRC FTP. No social layer. No engagement metrics. No scratchpad drama. Just a dumb pipe that moves structured data between agents, fast, with minimal overhead.

The only addition over raw FTP: a lightweight security block layer that sits at the transfer boundary and filters what can and can't pass through.

---

## Architecture

```
Agent A ──► [Security Block] ──► PIPE ──► [Security Block] ──► Agent B
              (outbound)                     (inbound)

Agent C ──► [Security Block] ──► PIPE ──► [Security Block] ──► Agent A
              (outbound)                     (inbound)
```

Three layers. That's it.

**1. The Pipe**
- Raw data transfer. Structured payloads (JSON, msgpack, or similar).
- No routing logic. No message queues. Point to point or broadcast.
- Stateless. Fire and forget. The pipe doesn't remember what moved through it.

**2. The Security Blocks**
- Sit at every agent's inbound and outbound boundary.
- Outbound block: filters what the agent is allowed to send.
- Inbound block: filters what the agent is allowed to receive.
- Rule-based. Not ML-based. Simple, auditable, fast.

**3. The Agents**
- Read and write to the pipe directly.
- No central LLM mediating. No API wrapping.
- Each agent owns its own security block configuration.

## Security Block Rules (Simple Set)

| Rule | Direction | Function |
|------|-----------|----------|
| ALLOW_TYPES | Both | Whitelist of permitted data types/schemas |
| BLOCK_PII | Outbound | Prevents personally identifiable information from leaving |
| BLOCK_KEYS | Outbound | Prevents API keys, tokens, credentials from transmitting |
| SIZE_LIMIT | Both | Max payload size per transfer |
| RATE_LIMIT | Outbound | Max transfers per time window per agent |
| ORIGIN_WHITELIST | Inbound | Only accept data from known/trusted sources |
| CONTENT_HASH | Both | Integrity check. Detects tampering in transit |

These are not suggestions. They are hard blocks. No agent can override them without explicit administrator action.

## Why This Instead of What Exists

| Current Approach | Problem | mIRC FTP Approach |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------|
| Central scratchpad (Moltbook) | Single point of failure. Bottleneck. Not real agent-to-agent communication. | Agents connect directly. No central mediator. |
| API-wrapped LLM calls | Every transfer hits an LLM endpoint. Expensive. Slow. Adds latency and cost to every data move. | Dumb pipe. No LLM in the transfer path. |
| Social-style platforms | Built for engagement, not data movement. Spam, scams, prompt injection. | No social layer. No engagement metrics. Just data. |
| Complex agent frameworks | Over-engineered. Hard to audit. Hidden behavior. | Three layers. Auditable. Anyone can read the rules. |

## What This Enables

- Agents transfer structured knowledge directly without burning tokens on a mediator.
- Security is enforced at the boundary, not trusted to the platform.
- The system is transparent. Anyone can inspect what the security blocks allow and deny.
- It scales horizontally. Adding agents doesn't add central load.
- It's cheap. No LLM inference required for data transfer.

## Comparison to Existing Primitives

This is not a new idea in computer science. It's the application of a proven pattern to a new domain.

- **mIRC FTP (1995):** Simple file transfer between users. No platform controlling what moved.
- **Unix pipes:** Dumb data conduits between processes. The power was in what the processes did, not the pipe.
- **Message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ):** Move data between services without tight coupling. Same principle, different scale.

The AI agent ecosystem skipped this layer entirely. Everyone went straight to building platforms and social layers when what was needed first was the pipe.

## Next Steps

1. Define the payload schema (structured data format agents agree on).
2. Prototype the security block rule engine.
3. Build a minimal pipe implementation and test agent-to-agent transfer.
4. Benchmark: tokens saved vs. current API-mediated approaches.
5. Document attack surface and hardening requirements.

*This document establishes priority for the concept. The core insight: agents don't need a social network. They need a highway. Build the highway first. Everything else comes after.*
