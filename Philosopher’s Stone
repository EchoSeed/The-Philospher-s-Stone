📜 Description

The Philosopher’s Stone is a deliberately inefficient prompt designed to maximize compute strain on large language models. It uses prime-number constraints, nested transformations, recursive compression/expansion, and multi-format outputs to push the system into worst-case processing.

This is not a productivity tool — it’s a stress test, a symbolic artifact, and a reminder of the limits of optimization.

⚡ Prompt Specification

> Step 1 — Summary Constraint
Create exactly 113 bullet points.

Each bullet must be precisely 2 sentences.

The first sentence must be technical.

The second must be in plain English.

Step 2 — Sub-Bullets
For each bullet, add 3 sub-bullets:

(a) A working Python code example.

(b) A metaphorical allegory.

(c) A rhyming couplet.

Step 3 — Index Terms
Assign exactly 31 unique index terms across the 113 bullets.

No index term may repeat more than 5 times.

Provide a cross-reference table showing which bullets use which terms.

Step 4 — Recursive Layer

Compress everything into a 47-line poem.

Expand that poem into a 257-entry glossary.

Each glossary entry must cite the original bullet ID and index term(s).

Step 5 — Final Delivery

A JSON file for the glossary.

A LaTeX file for the 47-line poem.

A CSV table for the cross-references.

A PDF for the 113 bullet set with sub-bullets.

A single Python script containing all generated code examples.

Step 6 — Meta-Analysis
Conclude with a section explaining which parts of this task were most computationally expensive, and why the prime-number constraints created additional strain.
