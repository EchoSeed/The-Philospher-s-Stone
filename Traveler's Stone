📜 Description

The Traveler’s Stone is a compact version of The Philosopher’s Stone. It preserves the same design principles — prime-number constraints, recursive compression/expansion, and multi-format output — but uses smaller primes to keep it barely executable.

This makes it suitable for live demonstrations, stress tests on smaller contexts, or symbolic use where the full Philosopher’s Stone would be impractical.

⚡ Prompt Specification

> Step 1 — Summary Constraint
Create exactly 31 bullet points.

Each bullet must be exactly 2 sentences.

The first sentence must be technical.

The second must be in plain English.

Step 2 — Sub-Bullets
For each bullet, add 2 sub-bullets:

(a) A short Python code snippet.

(b) A rhyming couplet.

Step 3 — Index Terms
Assign exactly 17 unique index terms across the 31 bullets.

No index term may repeat more than 3 times.

Provide a cross-reference table showing which bullets use which terms.

Step 4 — Recursive Layer

Compress everything into an 11-line poem.

Expand that poem into a 29-entry glossary.

Each glossary entry must cite the original bullet ID and index term(s).

Step 5 — Final Delivery

A JSON file for the glossary.

A LaTeX snippet for the 11-line poem.

A CSV table for the cross-references.

A PDF for the 31 bullet set with sub-bullets.

A single Python script containing all code snippets.

Step 6 — Meta-Analysis
End with a reflection describing which parts of this task were most computationally expensive, and how prime-number constraints shaped the difficulty.
